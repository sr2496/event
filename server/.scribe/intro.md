    - **Vendors** to manage their profiles, accept bookings, and respond to emergencies
    - **Admins** to oversee platform operations, verify vendors, and manage emergencies

    <aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
